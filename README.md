Introduction
The car price prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car based on its characteristics, such as the make, model, engine size, mileage, and other relevant factors. This can be useful for car buyers, sellers, and dealers in making informed decisions about pricing and negotiations.

Dataset
The project utilizes a publicly available dataset of car sales, which includes information about the car's make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and the final sale price. The dataset is sourced from [source name] and can be downloaded from [dataset link].

Features
The dataset includes the following features:

Make: The manufacturer of the car.
Model: The specific model of the car.
Year: The year the car was manufactured.
Mileage: The total distance the car has been driven.
Engine Size: The displacement of the car's engine.
Price: The final sale price of the car.
Model
The project employs a supervised learning approach, using a [model name] algorithm to predict the car's price based on the input features. The model was trained and evaluated using standard machine learning techniques, such as cross-validation and performance metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Usage
To use the car price prediction model, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies (see the Installation section).
Run the prediction script, providing the necessary input features:
css
Copy
python predict_price.py --make "Toyota" --model "Camry" --year 2020 --mileage 50000 --engine_size 2.5
The script will output the predicted price of the car.
Installation
To set up the project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
You can install the dependencies using pip:

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
